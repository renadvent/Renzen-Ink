# ink-app
java drawing application (rewrite complete!)

## Description
The focus on this app is on unusual drawing tools. So far I have implemented the "Caster" tool, and a different take on the standard brush found in most drawing apps. Eventually regular and more common drawing tools will also be added to the app.

## How to use it 


## Demonstration

This is the default outline included in the repository

To use the "Caster" tool, you click on "Create New Caster". and then click twice on the screen. These two points will will then create a line.
From this line, The app will generate lines perependicular to it. These lines will then intersect with the outline in the photo.
By default, These lines will then strike the outline, and generate lines between those intersections.

You can also choose "Cast Shade". In this case, the intersected points will continue  through the outline until they strike again.
The app will then generate lines between the two intersections. This allows you to "fill" and outline with strokes.

You can also log into Renzen.io and add screenshots to your profile or add them to an article you've already written. This allows you to have an article that keeps a running stream of your progress on your art to show your friends and communities on the site! (I am not an artist)
