any graphic/visual elements should go in the view part. Anything
related to the data should go to the model part and then the controller
goes between the data and view.

Whenever your view needs to read or write data, it should go through the
controller, never directly to the model.

One way to design it is to have your controller be one big class that
contains a model.

MVC can be complicated, but as long as you are comfortable with object
oriented design, it gets easier.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Model contains information and notifies listeners of changes

Controller functions:
(view can call)


//getters

current_selected()
change_selected()

prop_pan()


//creators

new_texture()
new_caster()
new_frame()
new_part()
new_component()
new_constraint()

remove()

// tool

// actions

change_strikes()
change_tolerance()

show_base()
show_strokes()
show_tools()

show_highlight()
